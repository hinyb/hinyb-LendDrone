# hinyb-LendDrone
* This is a small mod that adds the ability to lend your drone to your friend. It cost gold when lend(Configurable).
* Now it should work with sniper's skill. But the solution may break the other drone mods.
* If you have a better way to deal with this problem, please tell me.

## How to use
1. Place your mouse on the drone you want to lend.
2. Press Delete to lend your drone to your friend.
